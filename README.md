Getting it

Open crawler/crawler.properties and adjust crawling parameters as necessary.


Running
-------

Start Merilo by executing run.sh. It is strongly recommended to take a look inside run.sh and try out each step manually first.

Merilo was initially created by Frank Wathne and Kristoffer Dyrkorn. The work has later been kindly donated to Open Source by the Research Council of Norway.
